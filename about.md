# Anime & Movie Search

Search for your favorite anime show, anime movie, or a random one to find out its star rating, amount of episodes, and short description!

## App Description

An input is needed to begin a specific search for an anime or an anime movie. If the user desires specifically a TV or movie, then the filter can be applied onto the typed in search. The exclusion of NSFW genre is fixed and cannot be changed. The user can also press random search to find a random anime.

## Jikan API 

The Jikan API is used to display anime shows, movies, and random anime. It displays an image, title, score if known, episodes, and a short description of the media. It currently uses Jikan API 4.0.0. It is an open source API. More can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/).

I did not upload the images around the main box, but the cat image still remains in while hovering above the box.
